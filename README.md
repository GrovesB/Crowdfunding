# Crowdfunding
2022 U of M Book Camp - Module #1 

## Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
•	Theater did the best in the number of pledges with successes and fail, where plays got the most activity by subcateogry. July was the most successful date for activity in the successes. Journalism has the lowest response of pledges, but best success.

## What are some limitations of this dataset?
•	Seems to be skewed to have a high percentage of participants pledging for play campaigns as a subcategory.

## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
•	Percentage of total would be important. While we can see that plays had the most activity, that doesn’t mean it was the most successful in campaigning. Looking at the geographic location and year would be informative as well to understand the turnaround in campaigns. Graphing average donation would also be informative, as would evaluating outliers that would skew the data.
